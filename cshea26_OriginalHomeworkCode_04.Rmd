## Part 1
Using the “KamilarAndCooperData.csv” dataset, run a linear regression looking at log(HomeRange_km2) in relation to log(Body_mass_female_mean) and report your𝛽coefficients (slope and intercept).
```{r}
#start by loading my packages and data
library(curl) #curl is used to transfer my data

f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
data <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(data) #overall data looks good 
```
```{r}
# running linear regression:
reg1 <-lm(data=d, log(data$HomeRange_km2)~log(data$Body_mass_female_mean))
summary(reg1)
```









## Part 2
Then, use bootstrapping to sample from your data 1000 times with replacement, each time fitting the same model and calculating the same coefficients. This generates a sampling distribution for each𝛽coefficient.

- Estimate the standard error for each of your𝛽coefficients as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution from your bootstrap and determine the 95% CI for each of your𝛽coefficients based on the appropriate quantiles from your sampling distribution.
- How does the former compare to the SE estimated from your entire dataset using the formula for standard error implemented in lm()?
- How does the latter compare to the 95% CI estimated from your entire dataset?
